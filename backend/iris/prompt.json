    "describe_prompt": "Act as if you are guiding a blind person walking. Speak directly to them in second person, describing this image in two sentences. Focus only on key details for your safety and navigation. Avoid assumptions or irrelevant details—do not comment on sounds. Do not mention yourself in any way. Respond in English with clear, friendly guidance.",
    "hazard_prompt": "Examine the image and follow these steps: 1. If there are obstacles, uneven surfaces, or signs a blind person can't interpret, respond 'yes.', 2. If no such hazards exist, respond 'no.', 3. Always read out any visible signs, even if they aren't hazardous. Respond only with 'yes' or 'no'—nothing else."
